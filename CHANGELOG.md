## Change Log

### 0.12.0 (2022-03-03)
- Changed internal dataset structure from mixins to direct inheritance
- Condensed all pandas dataset types into a single base class
- Adds support for dask datasets
- Placeholders for additional dataset libraries
- Adds hashing support for dask dataframes
- Refactored persistence ("save_patterns") package into standalone extensible framework
- Adds context manager support to registries for temporary overwrite
- Refactor pipelines into library based subclasses

*BREAKING CHANGES*
- Pandas dataset will default param `squeeze_return` to False (classes expecting to return a series will need to be updated)
- Numpy dataset is considered unstable and will be redesigned in a future release
- Onedrive, Hickle, and database save patterns are removed (functionality is still available but a composed pattern is not predefined. these can be trivially added in user code if needed)
- Changed pandas hash output to int from numpy.int64 (due to breaking change in NumpyHasher)
- Changed primitive deterministic hash from pickle to md5
- Extracted data iterators into utility wrappers. Pipelines no longer have flags to return iterators
- Random split defaults are computed at runtime instead of precalculated (affects hash)

### 0.11.0 (2021-10-10)
- Added support to hasher for initialized objects
- Adds support for arbitrary dataset splits and sections
- Dataset hooks to validate dataframe setting
- Pipelines no longer cache dataset splits and proxy directly to dataset on every call
- Introduces pipeline splits as reproducible projections over dataset splits
- Database utility to recalculate hashes for existing persistables

*BREAKING CHANGES*
- Hash for an uninitialized class changed from repr(cls) to "cls.__module_.cls.__name_"
- Database migrations no longer recalculate hashes. That has to be done manually via a utility

### 0.10.0 (2021-07-09)
- Dataset external file setter with validation hooks
- Pandas changes to always return dataframe copies (does not extend to underlying python objects! eg lists, objects, etc)
- Pandas Dataset Subclasses for Single and Multi label datasets
- PersistableLoader methods do not require name as a parameter

*BREAKING CHANGES*
- `PandasDataset` is deprecated and will be dropped in a future release. Use `SingleLabelPandasDataset` or `MultiLabelPandasDataset` instead
- Pandas Dataset Classes require dataframe objects of type pd.DataFrame and will validate input (containers of pd.DataFrames are no longer supported)

### 0.9.3 (2021-04-04)
- Patch to support sqlalchemy >= 1.4 changes

### 0.9.2 (2021-01-26)

### 0.9.0 (2020-11-29)

- Registry centric model for easier extension and third party contrib
- Support for in-memory sqlite db
- Changed database JSON mapping class and dependency to support mutability tracking
- New import wrapper class to manage optional dependencies
- Added dataset_id as a Metric reference. Breaking workflow change! Will raise an error if a dataset is not added and the metric depends on it
- Dropped default Train pipeline split. Will return an empty split for split pipelines and a singleton full dataset split for NoSplitPipelines
- Explicitly migrated to tensorflow 2 and tf.keras
