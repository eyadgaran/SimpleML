SimpleML Enterprise Edition
===========================


Why Enterprise?
---------------

SimpleML is geared towards data scientists, automating the repetitive workflow
and extending their capabilities. The enterprise version aims to do the same
for the rest of the organization by enabling analysts, developers, operations,
and potentially even end-users to utilize machine learning. The platform
is designed to be non-technical, but builds upon SimpleML to yield the same
functionality for training models and extends beyond that to cover the entire
workflow.


Enterprise Features
-------------------
  - End-to-end facilitation of ML lifecycle
  - Dataset Explorer
  - Drag & Drop GUI for anyone in the organization to train models
  - Automated Dev-Ops for single click model deployment
  - Metric analysis for post-deployment stability


Moving to Enterprise, and Back Again
------------------------------------

SimpleML enterprise is intentionally built around the open-source core, so developer
functionality and interaction will not change. Non technical developers (analysts and/or devops)
will lose access to the visual GUI and deployment shortcuts. *Again, all the same
code functionality will remain, but it will require developers to code it up.*


Pricing
-------

Enterprise use is customizable and can be tailored to every organization's needs.
