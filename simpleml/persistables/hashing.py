        Makes a hash from a dictionary, list, tuple or set to any level, that
        contains only other hashable types (including any lists, tuples, sets, and
        dictionaries). In the case where other kinds of objects (like classes) need
        to be hashed, pass in a collection of object attributes that are pertinent.
        For example, a class can be hashed in this fashion:

        custom_hasher([cls.__dict__, cls.__name__])

        A function can be hashed like so:

        custom_hasher([fn.__dict__, fn.__code__])

        python 3.3+ changes the default hash method to add an additional random
        seed. Need to set the global PYTHONHASHSEED=0 or use a different hash
